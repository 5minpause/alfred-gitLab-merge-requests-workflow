# alfred-gitLab-merge-requests-workflow
A small workflow for Alfred

If you want to quickly access your assigned Merge Requests in GitLab, you can use this workflow.
If you pass the query "review" you can also see the merge requests where you are assigned as a reviewer **and have not approved yet**.

Will open a new tab in your default browser.

### Requires configuration!
You will need to add your GitLab username in the workflow's configuration.
You also need to provide your GitLab's URL.

### Status
For now this is done. In the future I might add things like access repositories directly, or todos.
Today though, this has all I need.

If you feel the need to add something, please go ahead and modify the workflow. As it doesn't have any code yet, it's only the workflow file that you'll need to add to Alfred. You can then edit the workflow there.
